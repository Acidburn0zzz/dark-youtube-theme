dark-youtube-ffox-addon
=======================

A minimalistic&fast addon for firefox that injects some custom grey-ish css on your page when visitng youtube.
It's still WIP and it only works if you're signed in (matches only https://www.youtube.com urls)
Get it from here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-youtube-theme

I got that icon from a random website and it was licensed under CC
